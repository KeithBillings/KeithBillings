### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
#### I am a front end web developer who specializes in React, and React frameworks. 
I graduated from the University of Oregon's full stack web development program and received accolades from my teaching staff, classmates, and recruiters. I graduated with straight A's, the beginning of a new network, and a certification. Other than learning MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, I also learned MySQL, Git, jQuery, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Google APIs, NASA APIs, version control, and how to work in an Agile environment.

I then never stopped learning and immediately began courses through Udemy to gain even more knowledge. I wanted to improve my skills in React, so I began a course teaching Redux, GraphQL, Stripe, and Firebase. Along the way I learned Next.js, Typescript, SCSS, Shopify, and more!

Currently part of a start up, and have learned Google Authenticaiton, Facebook authentication, and how to integrate the front end apis to a Django backend. 

My current favorite framework is Next.js.
